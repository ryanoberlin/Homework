# ISTA220 C# Chapter 17 Homework

### Ryan Oberlin

1. What is a type parameter?  
*a place holder*

2. What does a type parameter do?  
*allow implementation for different types*

3. How many type parameters can a generic class have?  
*multiple*
4. What is the difference between a generic class and a generalized class?  
*generalized classes focus on similar functionality, where generic classes focus on similar implementation*

5. What is a constraint? How do you specify a constraint?  
*a restriction on the implementation, in the class definition*

6. What is a generic method? How do you define a generic method?  
*a method declared with only type parameters*
7. What do we mean when we say that a generic type interface is invariant?  
*an object of one type can be substituted for another type*

8. What do we mean when we say that a generic type interface is covariant?  
*an object of one type is a subtype of another*
9. Does covariance work with value types? Does it work with reference types?  
*It does not work with value types, it does work with reference types*

10. What do we mean when we say that a generic type interface is contravariant?
*the subtype is reversed*
