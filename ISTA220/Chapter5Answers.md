1.) Compound assignment operators assign new values to variables. The variable is only evaluated once making code more efficient.

2.) += -= *= /= %=

3.) while(number < 50) 
	number += 5;

4.) until it doesn't 

5.) It continues to run

6.) it has 3 parts, intilized variable, evaluated condition, and afterthought/clean up. Yes. If you omit all sections it will be evaluated as while(true)

7.) 
```C#

do {
	code_here();
   }while(condition);
```

8.) break; terminates the loop.

9.) passes control to the loop that it's enclosed in.
