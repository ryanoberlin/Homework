### Ryan Oberlin
1. What is an interface as the term is used on object-oriented programming?  
*It defines rules that enforce behavior*  

2. How do you define an interface?  
*The interface keyword*  

3. Can an interface have variables, fields, or properties?  
*No*  

4. How do you define a method in an interface?  
*Yes.*  

5. Can you instantiate an object through an interface? Why or why not?  
*Yes. Remove dependencies.*  

6. Using the new keyword, can you declare a reference to an interface?  
*yes*  

7. Can an object inherit from multiple interfaces? Can a class implement multiple interfaces? If so, how can it do so?  
*Yes. Class : Interface1 : Interface2*

8. What does it mean to explicitly implement an interface?  
*Defines what part of the interface to reference, similar to casting*

9. What are the restrictions on interfaces?
*it cannot contain fields, operators, constants, instance constructors*  

10. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?  
*an abstract class can contain implementation, an interface does not*  

11. What is an abstract method?  
*a method without implementation*

12. What is an sealed class?  
*It prevents inheritance*
13. What is an sealed method?
