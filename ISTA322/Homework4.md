# ISTA322 Homework 4

### Ryan Oberlin
1. Using automatic properties is a shortcut that avoids several explicit steps. List the steps that the use of automatic properties avoids.  
*defining a field or specifying the code in the getter and setter.*  

2. Using the object initializer syntax is a shortcut that avoids several explicit steps. List the steps that the use of object initializers avoids.  
*create the object, set parameter values, and call the object in the view method*

3. What is the purpose of creating extension methods?  
*adding a method to a class you do not own or cannot modify*

4. What is the one feature of extension methods that will always allow you to identify a method as an extension method?  
*using the this key word in front of the first parameter*
5. How do you create an extension method that filters the results returned by the method on a user specified criterion?  
*extension methods can filter object lists using the yield keyword*

6. Explain the syntax of a lambda expression. The term “lambda expression” originates in the lambda calculus developed by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930’s. There is a class of programming languages that are based on the fundamental ideas of lambda calculus.  
*Func<>, it allows a local function to be passed as an argument or returned as a value*  

7. This will require some outside research. What is the distinction between an anonymously typed variable and a dynamically typed variable?  
*anonymously typed variables are compiler generated. dynamically typed variables are evaluated at run time by the CLR.*
8. You are having a discussion about C# with a friend of yours that uses another language. You are telling him about C#’s LINQ library. How would you describe to him the  
difference between LINQ’s SQL-like notation and LINQ’s dot notation?  
*they can both get the same result. The only difference is the syntax*  

9. What, exactly, does the await keyword do?  
*it allows for code to do work while waiting for code in the background while to finish.*
10. What is the connection between await and the async keywords?
*Async methods contain at least one await statement*
