# Project Ideas for MSSA Cohort 4 20FEB18

## File Transfer Protocol Proof of Concept
Develop a proof of concept file transfer protocol that utilizes simulated qubits in Q# that is managed by a C# User Interface and 
Translation Layer. Protocol requirements include preshared confirmation key. Need to identify a solution to two generals problem 

## Chemical  Reaction Simulator
Model molecular interaction based on a database of atomic characteristics. Program needs to be scalable to other platforms.
Program must use multiple models to simulate different potential interactions outcomes. 

## Trial/Jury Verdict Prediction
Utilize Microsoft's CNTK and historical trial data to generate a machine learning algorithm that predicts jury verdicts. 
Incorporate the ability to select multiple models, Bayesian, Genetic, and Machine learned algorithms.
